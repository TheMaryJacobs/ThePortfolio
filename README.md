## Overview
Responsive portfolio using bootstap elements and responsive rows and columns for varying media sizes. 

## Description
I recreated my first portfolio site, using Bootstrap documentation, paired with minor custom CSS to modify certain elements. Most elements were designed with multiple classes to give them the desired appearance. Using the grid layout, I was able to achieve a fully responsive portfolio.
